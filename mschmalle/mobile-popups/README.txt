The point of this min popup framework was to create an abstract dialog 
and alert container system.

In this way, the developer is not constantly subclassing or making MXML 
SkinnablePopUpContainers.

The PopUp allows subclassing to enhance behaviors. The static methods are
only added as a convenience

CONTRIBUTIONS;

Feel free to let me know what you think (flex-dev@apache.org), positive 
and negatives of what I have written.

I took out the StageOrientationEvent that was dependent on mobile, so this
framework can be used in a desktop/browser application as well.

If there is interest in this project, I have all the Alert implementations
not commited yet.
