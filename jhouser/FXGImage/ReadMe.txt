Component contributed by Jeffry Houser (jhouser@apache.org)

This is a demonstration of a component, named FXGImage, which was created as a simple way to use an 
FXG Asset inside of a Flex Application.  I've used it to dispaly background images inside of 
mobile applications.

The submission is a Flash Builder Workspace which includes two projects, one is a library project and the 
second is a Flex Project.  You should be able to import the workspace into Flash Builder; or just use 
the code to create your own projects in alternate IDEs.
